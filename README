TODO:

Converting to to_html seems to be doing well, maybe use that for parsing multi-recs???

Make it export as json instead of html, html is so fugly -- turn Recs into a class and give it to_json and to_html_node methods, make the crawler be a proper class too (with ivars and instantiation and stuffs)

Maybe make a javascript bookmarklet or other thing that pulls tags from ao3 pages (rating, fandom, character, tags) and copies them to clipboard or something
