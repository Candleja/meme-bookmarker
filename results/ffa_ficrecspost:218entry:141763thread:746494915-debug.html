<dd>but couldn't good be good enough by lazulisong -  <i>"His dad is probably going to tell Stiles not to hang out with us," says Boyd, taking a sip of his Coke.
Isaac gives Derek an utterly betrayed look, and Erica glares at him. "I told you not to wear those sunglasses!" she hisses.
"What if Stiles can't hang out with us any more?" says Isaac wretchedly. "What if Scott doesn't want to hang out with us because --"
"I said those were pedophile sunglasses!" says Erica, in a quiet, piercing whisper that makes Derek's ears hurt.
Boyd continues eating his gyro, which he has laid out on a plate like a salad on a piece of flatbread, methodically picking out the tomatoes, feta and lamb and laying them to the side to eat after the lettuce. Boyd would eat his gyro if there was a bomb going off.</i>
Teen Wolf, Derek/Stiles main pairing but I can't remember if they actually get together in this fic or if it's just preslash. Anyway Beacon Hills having a local festival/carnival type deal and it's more about the pack enjoying that.

Dean/Castiel.  Canon universe. Also atmospheric, also creepy, contains some body horror that truly freaked me out.
<i>“After the apocalypse, Dean, Sam and Castiel settle into a gentler life, and Dean starts to make peace with the things that plagued him before 2009. Tentatively, carefully, he starts getting better.
But something lives in the woods, in the house; something calls to him in his dreams that crosses the lines between waking and sleep. Whilst trying to reconcile himself with himself, Dean finds himself wondering if the things he’s managed to build are really slipping away, or if the whole thing is just in his head.”</i>

<dd>The Battle of Betazed, through the conversations of Lwaxana Troi
(Not about the older series, just what Lwaxana was up to during the events of DS9, but I think it's probably accessible for people who haven't seen that. You just need to know that she and Odo got a marriage of convenience so that she could keep her kid by a guy with a very gender divided society, and that there is a war going on later.)

http://archiveofourown.org/works/292687
- With only 140 characters – sometimes the message gets lost in translation. Sometimes it results in a Sam Winchester, recently thrown into another dimension, thinking that his alternate-reality-fake-ego Jared Padalecki is in a romantic relationship with his co-star Misha Collins. And if he and Dean are supposed to pass for these actors, they will need to play their parts, even if that means pretending to be the boyfriend of some guy who looks a lot like a certain angel. Meanwhile, Misha is wondering what the hell is up with Jared.
