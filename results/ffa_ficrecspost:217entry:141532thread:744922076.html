<dd>IIRC it stops short of actual sex, but "Parts Per Million" by Legete focuses on alpha Steve both before and after the serum, including ruts.

<dd>This was an interesting spin on how some view alphas, though it's more about a young alpha dealing with that societal mindset than sex. 1D RPF

Supernatural RPF - Jared/Misha

<dd>Wolf in the Breast by Evren - really different, somewhat AU take on post-game events. Solas returns to Skyhold with a bunch of extremely pissed-off elven gods hot on his trail.

<dd>Elvhenan Arises series by evelynwaaaaah - this is a very lengthy series that is currently engrossed in a Cullen/OFC subplot, but it's explored post-game Solas a lot in earlier installments and seems likely to get back to that topic in the future. Of the current stories in the series, "A Wealth of Sorrows" is probably closest to what you want. http://archiveofourown.org/series/242476

<dd> - A Walk in the Karakorum by Daegaer. The fandom is Fix Bay'nets! by George Manville Fern which I have never read but which I gather is a jolly old Victorian adventure. So I read the fic as a fun old-timey sf adventure and it does work. Definitely includes dinosaurs.
